##How to run the app 
  1. Clone this repo.
  2. Open shell window and navigate to project folder.
  3. Run pod install.
  4. Open AloneTogether.xcworkspace in Xcode 12 and run the project on selected device or simulator, iOS 13 or later, to see the power.  
  5. To really see the power, run on a selected device AND simulator at the same time, and start meditating on both.

Enjoy!!
